				<h2>Chicken Andouille Sausage Gumbo</h2>
				by Zach Olson
				<h3>Ingredients</h3>
				<ul>
					<li>2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs</li>
					<li>2 quarts water</li>
					<li>1 pound fresh okra, cut into 1" pieces</li>
					<li>1/2 cup water</li>
					<li>1/2 cup unsalted butter</li>
					<li>1/2 cup corn starch</li>
					<li>1 1/2 cups yellow onion, diced</li>
					<li>1 1/2 cups bell pepper (green and red), diced</li>
					<li>1/3 cups celery, diced</li>
					<li>2 teaspoons minced garlic</li>
					<li>2 cups diced tomatoes</li>
					<li>12 ounces andouille sausage</li>
					<li>1 dried bay leaf</li>
					<li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
					<li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
					<li>1 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
					<li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
					<li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
					<li>1 tablespoon gumbo filé (I use Zatarain's)</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Directions</h3>
				<ol>
					<li>In a medium-sized pot, add the chicken and cover with 2 quarts of water. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a
						simmer until fully cooked, about 20 to 25 minutes. Strain and save the chicken broth.</li>
					<li>Remove the chicken from the pot, let it cool, then shred it into small pieces. Cover and set aside.</li>
					<li>In a medium-sized pot, add the okra and ½ cup of water. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and cover.
						Simmer, occasionally stirring, until tender, about 7 to 9 minutes. Transfer to a colander, drain and set
						aside.</li>
					<li>In a large Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed pot, combine butter and flour. Cook over medium heat, frequently
						stirring with a whisk, until a dark brown roux forms, about 15 minutes. If needed, increase the heat if you
						do not see a substantial color change. In the last 5 minutes, continuously stir so the roux does not burn.
					</li>
					<li>Add onion, bell peppers, celery, and garlic to the pot. Sauté until vegetables are tender, about 8 to 10
						minutes.</li>
					<li>Add the cooked okra, tomatoes, and sliced sausage. Cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
					<li>Add bay leaf, thyme, basil, cayenne, salt, and pepper.</li>
					<li>Stir in 4 cups of the reserved chicken broth. Loosely cover the pot and simmer over medium-low heat,
						occasionally stirring until the gumbo thickens, about 30 minutes.</li>
					<li>Add the cooked shredded chicken and simmer for 15 minutes.</li>
					<li>Turn off the heat and slowly stir in the gumbo filé. Do not reboil after adding, as this tends to make the
						gumbo stringy. Taste and season with more salt and pepper as desired. Add more chicken broth if you want a
						less thick consistency.</li>
					<li>serve over steamed rice.</li>
