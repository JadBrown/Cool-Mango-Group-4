                </ul>
                <li>sliced carrots (optional)</li>
                <li>Noodles (optional)</li>
                <li>dash of red wine vinnegar (optional)</li>
                <li>Dash of sugar (optional)</li>
                <li>butter (optional)</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Directions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Throw down some olive oil in a pot and heat to medium-high</li> 
                <li>Optionally throw in some butter with the olive oil</li> 
                <li>Cut your onions up however small you want them</li>
                <li>throw you onions into the pot with a teaspoon of the garlic</li>  
                <li>Wait for the onions to soften a bit and turn a translucent color</li> 
                <li>Once the onions are sufficiently soft, pour in your broth, greenbeans and tomatoes along with any other vegetables you wish to use</li>
                <li>(Opionally) here you can either throw in noodles of boil them separately I prefer to cook them separately so they don't get overcooked and the soup keeps better that way</li>
                <li>Throw in your italian herbs & spices</li>
                <li>Bring soup to a boil</li>
                <li>Let the soup boil for 5-10 minutes and then reduce to a simmer</li> 
                <li>Simmer until the ingredients are sufficiently softened</li> 
                <li>The soup is now ready to serve, here you can salt & pepper to taste</li> 
            </ol>
			
            <p>Here, I like to throw in a dash of either balsamic or red wine vinnegar and then some sugar to cut the acidity of the soup, but this is entirely optional.
                You can also add your cheeses, noodles or additional salt/pepper at the end to each individual serving per taste.
                Enjoy!
            </p>
